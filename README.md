This is my capstone project for DATA205 Spring 2025 at Montgomery College.

Over the past few months, I have worked really hard and done the best I can to work on an inventory optimization project for the county for a while. It has been a challenge and a roller coaster analyzing all the sales data across many different types of retail stores with high, medium, and low volume data. The goal: improve the algorithm for calculating Minimum Shelf Stock for alcohol products and Reorder Quantities using a smarter, data-driven approach. 🧠📈

🔍 Project Highlights:
 • Cleaned and explored 53 weeks of 2024 sales data using R
 • Designed and implemented two algorithms (baseline & improved model)
 • Factored in demand trends, delivery schedules, and sales variability
 • Created visualizations to evaluate performance across store types

 📊 What I Did: With weekly sales data from 2024, I rebuilt their inventory algorithm in RStudio to design a smart and responsive algorithm across different ABS stores. It uses trend detection, weighted averages, and variability checks to adapt more quickly to real changes in product demand.

🔧 Tools: RStudio, OpenRefine, tidyverse, ggplot2, plotly
🧪 Analysis: Statistical testing (McNemar’s Test), exploratory visualizations, real product comparisons
📦 Products analyzed: Vodka, Amaretto, and more

Results:
 • Moments of reduced excess inventory for some products
 • Improved reorder consistency for different items
 • Identified when current methods were too slow to react to change
 • Visual dashboards comparing original vs. improved models

💡 Key Takeaway: Inventory algorithms need to be more flexible. One-size-fits-all logic doesn’t work for products with volatile sales. My solution showed how to balance stock efficiency with availability better.

A huge thank you to the ABS Retail Division and the Department of Technology and Enterprise Business Solutions for giving me this incredible opportunity to work on this project with their data and to combine my analytical and statistical skills to help the county department. Also, a huge thank you to Lori A. Perine, Mais Alraee, and Rachel Saidi at Montgomery College for giving me the knowledge throughout this whole journey and giving me the opportunity to make this all possible.
